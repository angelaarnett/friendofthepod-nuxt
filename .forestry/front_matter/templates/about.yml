  description: Jonathan Kornman combines his background in radio (WVUM,Dublab), talent
    management (Liason Artists) and entertainment law (attorney licensed in California)
    to meet his clients’ podcasting needs. This includes everything from audio editing
    and production to project management and consulting. Helping creatives reach their
    potential is what drives Jonathan to be not just a collaborator but a genuine
    “friend of the pod”
